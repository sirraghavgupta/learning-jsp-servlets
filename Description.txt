in this project, i am not following the best practices and not even the folder structure.
so, i am writing a brief discussion of the flow of the urls and the servlet classes.

/ -> index.jsp - starting page - leads to add.jsp.
AddServlet -> SquaredServlet was executing after submitting the form in index file, but later we replaced
that with add.jsp just to show that we can do this with jsp also. so, they are just not been used right now, but
we can change the mapping anytime.

/jstl-demo -> JSTLDemoServlet -> jstlDemo.jsp

/exception-demo -> ExceptionHandlingDemo.jsp -> ErrorPage.jsp

/filter-demo -> AddUserServlet with 2 filters AddUserAgeFilter and AddUserNameFilter

/my -> servletContext and servletConfig demo

/login -> login form page login.jsp -> AuthServlet with AuthFilter and used AuthDao also.

/logout -> to logout the user

/welcome -> landing page if user logs in successfully.

/videos -> demo page for only the authenticated users.

 - Student class is just a POJO for demo use.
 - Now, i have mentioned comments extensively in the project. I have annotations and web.xml too.
   see them also.
